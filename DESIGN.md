2. Business account

1. Search Viewcontroller. A Screen where you can add your preferences (activities, festivals, dinner etc) through a drop-down menu.
2. Map Viewcontroller. Map of Amsterdam with pins representing activities of the user's preference.  When clicked on a pin, more detailed information about that activity will be loaded. There is also a 'more information' option and when clicked the user is send to the InformationDeal ViewController. You can also navigate across the map and new pins will automatically appear.
3. InformationDeal ViewController. More information about a deal and here a user can click 'Get the deal' so they are registered to that particular deal. 

## APIs and frameworks or plugins
To create this app the UIKit and UIMapKit library will be used. UIMapKit will be used to determine the current location of the user and to place activities and deals on the map. Firebase will be used to save preferences of users.
